# captureone_aspectpad
This program gives an image a frame, padding it out to a specified aspect ratio, center & colour.
The defaults are an instagram friendly aspect ratio of 1080 * 1350 and a black background.
Colour can be changed by passing a value to add_padding.

Use the aspectpad_runner automator app to launch the python file. This is what you set the C1 process recipe to open the file in. 

*[your path]* can be found by dragging this python file onto a terminal window and copy-pasting the
output. Don't forget to remove the [] surrounding [your path]!
